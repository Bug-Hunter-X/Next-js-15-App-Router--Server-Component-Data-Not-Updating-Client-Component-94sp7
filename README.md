# Next.js 15 App Router: Server Component Data Not Updating Client Component

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router where data fetched in a server component does not correctly update a client component when the data changes.  The issue occurs when there are multiple server components involved in the rendering process.

## Bug Description

The client component, despite re-rendering, does not reflect the updated data from the server component. This suggests a potential issue with data propagation or caching mechanisms within the App Router's server-side rendering pipeline.  The example shows the data being updated, but it doesn't trigger a re-render in the client component.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the initial data in the client component. Then, reload. Note the data does not change.

## Expected Behavior

The client component should reflect the updated data from the server component after a page refresh or data change.

## Actual Behavior

The client component shows the stale data, even after the data on the server component has changed.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates workarounds to address the problem in most cases.  These approaches focus on ensuring the data is appropriately re-fetched and re-rendered when changes occur. It is advised to explore these workarounds until official resolution from Next.js team.
